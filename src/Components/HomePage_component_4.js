                        This nonprofit organization is based on two very simple mottos â€“ Manava Sevaye Madhava Seva (Service to mankind is Service to God) and Sarve jana sukhino bhavantu (May all live happily). Anybody from anywhere in the world can make a request for help on any type of social media/communication device. This would be a purely volunteer based organization. Each request will be matched to a local volunteer so that this volunteer can provide help to this requestor by taking advantage of any local charity organizations or local help. Think of it like an international Lyft/Uber service or an international 911 service. Only requests related to food, clothes, housing, education, healthcare or any general advice would be honored.

                        This charity is beyond any god, religion, country or politics. At the same time, we respect all your beliefs and we do NOT desecrate any god, religion or politics. This charity will be the mother of all charities by linking them or collaborating with them, but it does NOT compete with any other charity. Only expenses will be reimbursed. No payments/salaries to any volunteers or charity organizing/management members.
